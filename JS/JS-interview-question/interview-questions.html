/* 1) What is javascript?
    - javascript is a scripting programing language, since it is interceptor which checks each line if any errors are found then it doesn't proceed further.
    - javascript is a loosely coupled language since it doesnt follow any strict datatypes.
    - javascript are usedd to make the user to interact with the application

    2) what is variable rules?
      - only camelcase or $ dollar symbol and underscore symbol are allowed.is

    3)what is variable or function hoisting?
     -Hoisting is the dafault behaviour of moving declaration/initializar on top of the scope before the code execution in js

     
          EX:2 function declaration 
     {
       function welcome(){
       	console.log("hi welcome");
       }
       welcome();                     NOTE:Before or after the declaration also code will execute since automatically declaration will be moved top of the scope

     }
     EX:2 function Expersion 
    {
       
    	let greet=function subwelcome(){
    		console.log("hellow");
    	}
    	 greet();                     NOTE:function cant called before the intializer/declaration in first class function/function Expersion

   }
      
    4)What is loosely coupled/typed or dynamic coupled language?
   Javascript is a loosely coupled language since during the runtime we can change the value of data types of variable and it doesnt follow  the strict datatype as  in java programing language.

       EX:1

      {

         let x="EDWIN";

        console.log(x);

        x=2;

        console.log(x);


       }

   4)What is dynamic coupled language?
        javascript itself/automatically understand the variable data types called dynamic coupled language.

       EX= let name ="EDWIN";         NOTE: we never mentioned the datatype for a variable since it javascript itself understand datatype of variable.
      
   5) What is declaration and intialization?
      Declation : Informing the javascript that variable by let/const/var have been declared the variable by let/const/var and 
      value for the variable is not assigned.Declation.Declation

      Ex: let number;

      Intialization: Informing the javascript that value for the variable is assigned are called initilization.

      Ex: let number= 10;

  6) What is undefined, not defined, null?
   Undefined = If the value for the variable is not assigned then result shows undefined.

  not defined = if the variable value/intialization is assigned after the print statment  then it shows not defined.

  null = null primitive data types is assigned where the variable value need to store the 0 value and this variable intialization can be done in future.*/
