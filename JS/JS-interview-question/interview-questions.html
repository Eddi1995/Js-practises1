/* 1) What is javascript?
    - javascript is a scripting programing language, since it is interceptor which checks each line if any errors are found then it doesn't proceed further.
    - javascript is a loosely coupled language since it doesnt follow any strict datatypes.
    - javascript are usedd to make the user to interact with the application

    2) what is variable rules?
      - only camelcase or $ dollar symbol and underscore symbol are allowed.is

    3)what is variable or function hoisting?
     -Hoisting is the dafault behaviour of moving declaration/initializar on top of the scope before the code execution in js

     
          EX:2 function declaration 
     {
       function welcome(){
       	console.log("hi welcome");
       }
       welcome();                     NOTE:Before or after the declaration also code will execute since automatically declaration will be moved top of the scope

     }
     EX:2 function Expersion 
    {
       
    	let greet=function subwelcome(){
    		console.log("hellow");
    	}
    	 greet();                     NOTE:function cant called before the intializer/declaration in first class function/function Expersion

   }
      
    4)What is loosely coupled/typed or dynamic coupled language?
   Javascript is a loosely coupled language since during the runtime we can change the value of data types of variable and it doesnt follow  the strict datatype as  in java programing language.

       EX:1

      {

         let x="EDWIN";

        console.log(x);

        x=2;

        console.log(x);


       }

   4)What is dynamic coupled language?
        javascript itself/automatically understand the variable data types called dynamic coupled language.

       EX= let name ="EDWIN";         NOTE: we never mentioned the datatype for a variable since it javascript itself understand datatype of variable.
      
   5) What is declaration and intialization?
      Declation : Informing the javascript that variable by let/const/var have been declared and 
      value for the variable is not assigned.

      Ex: let number;

      Intialization: Informing the javascript that value for the variable is assigned are called initilization.

      Ex: let number= 10;

  6) What is undefined, not defined, null?
   Undefined = If the value for the variable is not assigned then result shows undefined.

  not defined = if the variable value/intialization is assigned after the print statment  then it shows not defined.

  null = null primitive data types is assigned where the variable value need to store the 0 value and this variable intialization can be done in future.
		
 7)In string method string is immutable or what?
  -In string method string is immutable since this print value cant be change in the original string.
 
  8)In Array method array is immutable or what?
  -In array method array is non immutable since this print value can be change in the original array.
  
  9)What is DOM(Document object model)?
  - Dom is a representation of code in DOM Trees structure so that computer can understand the code.
  - DOM is a specification by W3C (world wide web consoritium).
  - Dom is a platform and language interface which helps the programe(HTML) and JS dynamically access and update the content and structure and style of documents.
  
  10)What is web API?
  -API stands for Application programe interface which act as a interface b/w two web app to share the data from one web app to another web app.
  Ex:Json,DOM
  
  11)What is quaring?
  - Quaring is the process of accessing the element and getting the value/data.
  
  12) Id in tag can be duplicate or not?
  - It is not supposed to be duplicate because in JS when quaring an element only first element will be selected in JS/DOM method.
  
  13)Types of Dom methods to access the html tags?
  -document.getElmentsById("xx")
   -document.getElmentsClassName("xx")
   -document.getElmentsByTagName("xx")
    -document.querySelector("#xx")
    -document.querySelectorAll("xx")
  
  

14) What is the use of innerHTML and outterHTML?
-By innerHTML we are informing the browser to add the values/elements inside the tag but outtterHTML removes the tag and add the values/elements in that place.  */
