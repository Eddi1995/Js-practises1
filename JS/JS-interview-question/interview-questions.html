/* 1) What is javascript?
    - javascript is a scripting programing language, since it is interceptor which checks each line if any errors are found then it doesn't proceed further.
    - javascript is a loosely coupled language since it doesnt follow any strict datatypes.

    2) what is variable rules?
      - only camelcase or $ dollar symbol and underscore symbol are allowed.is

    3)what is variable or function hoisting?
     -Hoisting is the dafault behaviour of moving declaration/initializar on top of the scope before the code executin.is

     
          EX:2 function declaration 
     {
       function welcome(){
       	console.log("hi welcome");
       }
       welcome();                     NOTE:Before or after the declaration also code will execute since automatically declaration will be moved top of the scope

     }
     EX:2 function Expersion 
    {
       
    	let greet=function subwelcome(){
    		console.log("hellow");
    	}
    	 greet();                     NOTE:function cant called before the intializer/declaration in first class function/function Expersion

   }
      
    4)What is loosely coupled/typed or dynamic coupled language?
   Javascript is a loosely coupled language since during the runtime we can change the value of data types of variable and it doesnt follow  the strict datatype as  in java programing language.

       EX:1

      {

         let x="EDWIN";

        console.log(x);

        x=2;

        console.log(x);


       }

   4)What is dynamic coupled language?
        javascript itself/automatically understand the variable data types called dynamic coupled language.

       EX= let name ="EDWIN";         NOTE: we never mentioned the datatype for a variable since it javascript itself understand datatype of variable.*/
