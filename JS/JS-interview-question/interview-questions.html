/* 1) What is javascript?
    - javascript is a scripting programing language, since it is interceptor which checks each line if any errors are found then it doesn't proceed further.
    - javascript is a loosely coupled language since it doesnt follow any strict datatypes.
    - javascript are usedd to make the user to interact with the application

    2) what is variable rules?
      - only camelcase or $ dollar symbol and underscore symbol are allowed.is

    3)what is variable or function hoisting?
     -Hoisting is the dafault behaviour of moving declaration/initializar on top of the scope before the code execution in js

     
          EX:2 function declaration 
     {
       function welcome(){
       	console.log("hi welcome");
       }
       welcome();                     NOTE:Before or after the declaration also code will execute since automatically declaration will be moved top of the scope

     }
     EX:2 function Expersion 
    {
       
    	let greet=function subwelcome(){
    		console.log("hellow");
    	}
    	 greet();                     NOTE:function cant called before the intializer/declaration in first class function/function Expersion

   }
      
    4)What is loosely coupled/typed or dynamic coupled language?
   Javascript is a loosely coupled language since during the runtime we can change the value of data types of variable and it doesnt follow  the strict datatype as  in java programing language.

       EX:1

      {

         let x="EDWIN";

        console.log(x);

        x=2;

        console.log(x);


       }

   4)What is dynamic coupled language?
        javascript itself/automatically understand the variable data types called dynamic coupled language.

       EX= let name ="EDWIN";         NOTE: we never mentioned the datatype for a variable since it javascript itself understand datatype of variable.
      
   5) What is declaration and intialization?
      Declation : Informing the javascript that variable by let/const/var have been declared and 
      value for the variable is not assigned.

      Ex: let number;

      Intialization: Informing the javascript that value for the variable is assigned are called initilization.

      Ex: let number= 10;

  6) What is undefined, not defined, null?
   Undefined = If the value for the variable is not assigned then result shows undefined.

  not defined = if the variable value/intialization is assigned after the print statment  then it shows not defined.

  null = null primitive data types is assigned where the variable value need to store the 0 value and this variable intialization can be done in future.
		
 7)In string method string is immutable or what?
  -In string method string is immutable since this print value cant be change in the original string.
 
  8)In Array method array is immutable or what?
  -In array method array is non immutable since this print value can be change in the original array.
  
  9)What is DOM(Document object model)?
  - Dom is a representation of code in DOM Trees structure so that computer can understand the code.
  - DOM is a specification by W3C (world wide web consoritium).
  - Dom is a platform and language interface which helps the programe(HTML) and JS dynamically access and update the content and structure and style of documents.
  
  10)What is web API?
  -API stands for Application programe interface which act as a interface b/w two web app to share the data from one web app to another web app.
  Ex:Json,DOM
  
  11)What is quaring?
  - Quaring is the process of accessing the element and getting the value/data.
  
  12) Id in tag can be duplicate or not?
  - It is not supposed to be duplicate because in JS when quaring an element only first element will be selected in JS/DOM method.
  
  13)Types of Dom methods to access the html tags?
  -document.getElmentsById("xx")
   -document.getElmentsClassName("xx")
   -document.getElmentsByTagName("xx")
    -document.querySelector("#xx")
    -document.querySelectorAll("xx")
  

14) What is the use of innerHTML and outterHTML?
-By innerHTML we are informing the browser to add the values/elements inside the tag but outtterHTML removes the tag and add the values/elements in that place. 
   

15)Event Propagation
Capturing phase = Event which travel(propagate) to all the element path from the root element and reaches the targeted element are called capturing.
  (Ex travelling from the outter to inner)
Bubbling phase = Event which lesves the targetted place and return back to the the root element are called bubbling phase.


16) what is stack memory location and heap memory location?
-stack memory (It works like last in first out) =  Once the initilizer is done this will be stored in stack memory location.

-heap memory = once the value is stored in stack memory location this value address will be stored  temproraly in heap memory location.

17)Diffence between client side(browser) validation and server side validation?
 - once the input is received from the end users as object it will be transferd to server (iteface) and then it will be transfered to database in database it check 
 validation then again it return to the server from the server side datas will transfed to client side as a JSON(object) format to the client side.

 18) what is regex(Regular Expression)?
- Regex is a pattern that match with the string input only.
- Regax is used all the programing languages.

19)Why regex pattern attributes required in Js form input?
-Pattern attributes are used to maatch with the user input and it is apllicable only for string input.

20) What is  Nullish coalescing(ES6 2020) (??) ?
 -According to Nullish coalescing only null and undefined are treated falsy (NOT 0 and "")

21) what is the difference between inbuilt HOF foEach,map,filter?

22)what constructor ? 
-A constructor is a special method that initialize a newwly created object of the type.

23) Javascript is synchronus or asynchronus?
 -Javascript is the synchronus single threaded language since it can behave like a asynchronus by call back function or using timer web API.
 
25) What is call back hell?
- If inner function exeution/result requires the parent function data or outter function are called call back hell.

 26) Sunchronus and Asynchronus?  (Refer the notbook for explanation);
    
 27)What is AJAX?
 - AJAX Stands for asynchronus javascript and XML.AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest 
   object to communicate with servers.It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.
          
 28) How promise work?  (promise is a container for future a synchronus operation)
  - promise is an object which are used as a placeholder for a future asynchronus operation.
