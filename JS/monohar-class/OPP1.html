   /*   1)What is paradigm?
      How we design/organize our code called paradigm.

     2)How traditional OOP (Object oriented program) work in low level languages?
      (creating the imagination into real object this process are called OOP, Ex:drawing blueprint pen to original pen)
     -Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain propeties(details) and methods (Behaviour).
     -OOP defines as the organizing the code in proper manner (Ex: Arrangement of book in library) since we cant write our code wherever we want.1

     class in OOP :
     - Class is a blueprint by using this object can be created are called instaneous and created object are called instance.
     - class which contains all the properties and method.                            //NOTE: From one class we can creat N numbers of object/child
     - Created object which contains properties and methods of class. 

 
     person{                 NOTE: This is class
      name,
      Age,
      col,
      code,
     }

     let employee1={          NOTE: This is object
      name:"Edwin A",
      Age:27,
      col:"vtu",
       code:105,
     }

      let employee2={          NOTE: This is object
      name:"Albert",
      Age:25,
      col:"christ",
      code:105,
     }
      
   3) What are the 4 fundamentles (basic or forming a necessary base or core) of OOPS?
     a)Abrstraction - (Hidding some functionality from users access to avoid some overwrite/damage src code Ex: push() method)
     b)Encapsulation - (Proctect some sensitive data using the private keyword Ex : capsule tablet);

          person{                 
           name,
           Age,
           col,
           private code,            //NOTE: When we add this private keyword we can not access this property outside the class.
           }

     c)Inheritants - (Child object/instance contains the properties of parent/class along with it contains the new property also);

         person{                 NOTE: This is class
      name,
      Age,
      col,
      code,
     }

     let employee1={          NOTE: This is object
      name:"Edwin A",
      Age:27,
      col:"vtu",
       code:105,
       Address:"koramangala",      NOTE: This property is newly added
     }

     d)Polymorphism - (child class can overwrite the method of parent/class in child class) or (many phases EX: add and concat)

      person{                                                    NOTE: This is parent class
           name,
           Age,
           col,
           favFood:function food(biriyani) {
              console.log(`${biriyani}`)
            }    

           }

             person{                                             NOTE: This is child class
           name,
           Age,
           col,
           favFood:function food(biriyani,poori) {
              console.log(`${biriyani} and ${poori}`);
            }    

           }

      4) What is prototype?
      -Prototype is an another object as a default and it is attached to created array/constructor

      NOTE : For drawing kindly refer the book


      5) There are 3 ways to create the Js to implment OOP
           1)constructor function (!imp);
           2)ES6 Classes
           3)object.create(we never use);




         1)constructor function 
                                             */

      {
         let person = function (name,year){                         //NOTE: use only normal function expersion or function declation 
            this.Firstname=name;                                      //since arrow function doesnt work
            this.birthyear=year;                                    //NOTE: This fn exp are used creates an object and object should 
                                                                           //contains two properties are name and year
           
         }

         let EDWIN=new person("Edwin",1995);  //(instaneous)
         console.log(EDWIN);                                       //new keyword are used to convert functio Exp to object and these 
                                                                     // are stored in variable.

        let Albert=new person("Albert",1995);
        console.log(Albert);

        person.prototype.calage=function(){          //since this calage mthod is added to the prototype of the person and this will
         console.log(this.birthyear);                   //be available in all the created object(prototype).
      }
        }
