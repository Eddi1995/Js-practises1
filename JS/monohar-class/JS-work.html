1. High-level(Memory allocation taken care by language like ex:int) - Every program that runs on your computer needs some hardware resources,
                 such as memory and the CPU to do its work. low-level languages, such as C,where you have to manually manage these resources.
                ou have high-level languages such as JavaScript and Python, where we do not have to manage resources at all 
                because these languages have so-called abstractions that take all of that work away from us. the language 
                easier to learn and to use, but the downside is that programs will never be as fast or as optimized as 
                for example, C programs.
                Note:low level language performance is more compared to high-level language

2. Garbage collection(browser part) - once the variable initilization is done, This garbage-collection looks the entire code if any code is not unused
                        then this garbage-collection automatically removes this memory and this memory will be used for another variable.garbage-collection is a powerful 
                        tools that takes memory management(tree shakable) to increase the performance of the webpage.
                        (one of the powerful tools that takes memory management away from developers is garbage-collection,
                        which is basically an algorithm inside the JavaScript engine, which automatically removes old, unused 
                        objects.from the computer memory in order not to clog it up with unnecessary stuff.which cleans  
                        memory from time to time so that we don't have to do it manually in our code.)

3. Interpreted or (Modern JS) JIT complied - JavaScript is an interpreted or just-in-time compiled language.the computer's processor only understands 
                                zeros and ones.  which is also called machine code. this code eventually needs to be translated to machine 
                                code. And that step can be either compiling or interpreting. this happens inside the JavaScript engine.

4. MultiParadigm( JS supports 3 Types are procedural,function and 00P) -  a paradigm is an approach and an overall mindset of structuring our code, which will ultimately direct 
                    the coding style and technique in a project that uses a certain paradigm.  three popular paradigms are procedural, 
                    object-oriented, and functional programming.So procedural programming is what we've been doing so far,which is basically just
                     organizing the code in a very linear way, and then with some functions in between. we can classify paradigms as imperative 
                     or as declarative, many languages are only procedural or only object-oriented or only functional,but JavaScript does all of 
                     it. So it's really flexible and versatile. And so we can do really whatever we want with it.

5. (JS supports only protoype oo)Prototype-based object-oriented - Everything in JavaScript is an object, except for primitive values such as numbers, strings, etc. 
                                    But arrays are just object. Now,  we can create an array and then use the push method on it, for example? 
                                    Well, it's because of prototypal inheritance. Basically, we create arrays from an array blueprint, which is 
                                    like a template and this is called the prototype. This prototype contains all the array methods and the 
                                    arrays that we create in our code then inherit the methods from the blueprint so that we can use them on the arrays. 

6. First-class functions - first-class functions, which simply means that functions are treated just as regular variables. 
                           so, we can pass   functions into other functions and we can even return functions from functions. and this allows for 
                           functional-programming, which is one of the paradigms and actually not all languages have first-class functions.

7. Dynamic language-  We don't assign data types to variables. Instead, they only became known when the JavaScript engine executes code. Also,
             the type of variables can easily be changedas we reassign variables. And this is basically what dynamically-typed means.

8. Single-threded & Non-blockung event loop - That means how the JavaScript engine handles multiple tasks happening at the same time.    

9.Call stack - JS engine can have only one call stack and call stack is the place where our is going to execute.
            - It is a piece of software where our code which helps to convert code to machine code


10.JS Engine - It contains only one call stack and heap stack
             - call stack contains only primitive data type
             - heap stack contains only non-primitive data type(unstructure memory pull which contail datat address)

11.NodeJs -It uses the chrome JS V8 engine outside the chrome.

12.compilation- src code is converted to machin code and this machine code(binary) is run in cpu.

13.Interpretation- src code is converts line by line and execute the first line.

14.(Modern JS) JIT complied -For definition refer the notebook.
