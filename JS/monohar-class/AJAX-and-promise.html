 // 1) Sunchronus and Asynchronus?  (Refer the notbook for explanation);
    
//     2)What is AJAX? (onc the user requested any info without any reload user receive the information so this process is done with the help of AJAX)
// //       AJAX Stands for asynchronus javascript and XML.AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript And XML. In a nutshell, it is the use of the XMLHttpRequest 
//    object to communicate with servers.It can send and receive information in various formats, including JSON, XML, HTML, and text files.
          
//  2) How promise work?  (promise is a container for future asynchronus operation)
//    promise is an object which are used as a placeholder for a future asynchronus operation.

    
   Ex: let newPromise= new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{         // Promise need two method are resolve(success) and reject(failure)
            if(Math.random()>0.5){
              resolve("you win");
            }
            else{
              reject("you lost");
            }

    });                  
                                                                                              //NOTE: then() and catch it is a predefined method (HOF) So it expect
                                                                                                              //the another function
    newPromise.then((store)=>{console.log(store)}).catch((store2)=>{console.log(store2)});    //store= It is the variable to store the resole value
